# Autogen
Mass-package ROMs with the same config into individual APKs.

## Usage
1. Place roms in the `input` directory
2. Copy the app's `config.xml` to the `input` directory and adjust it as needed
3. `python3 generate.py`
4. All APKs can be found in the `output` folder

The `input` folder can have subdirectories with their own configuration files. That means you can separate your ROMs into folders based on their core and include a config for each core in a separate folder. The Python script will recurse into each subdirectory with a `config.xml` file and build the ROMs accordingly.

## Example Structure
```
└── autogen

    |   |   ├── config.xml
    |   |   └── *.nes
